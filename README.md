The Bellini Digital Correspondence (BDC) project aims to provide a digital scholarly edition of the autograph letters written by Vincenzo Bellini and preserved at the Museo Civico Belliniano in Catania. The correspondence is comprised of approximately 40 textual units distributed across a substantial number of papers, which are further presented through over 100 digital images.
The BDC project is intrinsically connected to an educational framework and involves the encoding of a considerable portion of the corpus by students, interns, and participants of the “Texte Encoding” course at the University of Pisa. Taken in its entirety, the project involved multiple editorial phases, which encompass the creation, analysis, editing, display, and utilization of the Bellini corpus. The model proposed within this contribution is entirely general and adaptable to analogous contexts: BDC stands as an entirely open-source and open-access initiative.
Furthermore, BDC forms an integral component of the BellinInRete project, which is dedicated to the requalification and enhancement of the Museo Civico Belliniano through digital mediums. Concurrently, it seeks to develop a fresh approach to narrating the museum's tangible and intangible heritage.
BDC constitutes a multidisciplinary project supported by the Municipality of Catania in alignment with the “Patto per Catania - Fondo per lo Sviluppo e la Coesione (FSC) 2014/2020.” The project's execution has been overseen by the Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC) of the National Research Council of Italy in Catania, in collaboration with the Institute for Computational Linguistics «A. Zampolli» (ILC) of the National Research Council of Italy in Pisa.
